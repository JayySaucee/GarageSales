        <h1>My motivation and story...</h1>
        <p> Hello, my name is Jorge Alejandre and I am creating this site soley because I felt like it may be useful
            to others. I really got this idea from my mom, who actually expressed this problem to me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            For context, my parents love to spend their weekends going out on a nice day in search of finding great deals
            on items from garage/yard sales. But an issue that was commonly occurring was the issue of not knowing exactly where
            some may be set up at, and that is where garage sale finder comes in!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            With this application, the goal is to reduce the amount of time spent searching for sales in your local area, users will
            have the option of either browsing for sales, or creating their own to post for a selected amount of time. I hope this 
            application can help you out in one way or another!
        </p>
